1) LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the python interpreter must include the directory of
   graphbinomial.so for ldd to find it (when loading graphtool.so)
2) setup.py must know about the library dir
3) namespaces as described in
   http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/wrapping_CPlusPlus.html don't work. I
   get an unknown symbol error when importing the .so into the python
   interpreter.
